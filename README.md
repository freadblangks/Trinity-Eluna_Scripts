Some Eluna scripts I've been workign on.

Menu has a bunch of options. And Menu _NPC_BOTS has an added option to spawn the NPC that lets you hire Bots if server uses NPC_Bots from trickerer https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots
Most options in the menu can be turned off for non-GM players by changing variables from false to true. but if GMonly = true then the whole menu becoems only accessable by GM's of rank 3.
